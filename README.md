# pytorch-modules
Some pytorch modules that can be used directly

## Principle
- This repository is designed to help learn the various modules of neural networks.
- The implementation of each module is used as a reference and is not necessarily the best implementation.
- With slight adjustments, each module can be combined into a neural network adapted to each task.
- Provide a simple data loading and model training pipeline, but performance is not a consideration.
